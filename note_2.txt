Changes from The Thor Labs Components:

**ONLY FABRICATE THE STEP FILES**

This is V1 of trying to machine our own Thorlabs parts. They are compatible with each other, but not with the Thor Labs parts. In V2, we will attempt to make duplicates of the Thorlabs components at a lower cost.

Build this only if on a budget, or without access to a *great machining facility*. Buy the Thorlabs setup if you can. 

Thor labs using SM1 threading for the optics. Our local machine shop couldn't make threading that fine, so we adapted the parts to M27x1.5 which has a larger pitch, while keeping a similar optical axis diameter. The threading for mounts to the Camera, and lens remain the same

When we gave our parts for machining, we used an inner dia of 25 mm for M27x1.5 which damaged the thread tapping tool. For the drawings we are sharing, the inner dia to do before female threading has been updated to 25.5 mm.

The step files and drawings can be shared directly with a machine shop, and can be used as it is.

All parts except the cube, and the friction couplers can be made on a lathe. Our machine shop made the threads for the CM1 replacement on the VMC machine, since taps for this are not readily available.

This was made as a quick prototype. Some chamfering of edges etc is missing and can be added if needed for machining.

The length setter for the Variable couplers (SM1V05, SM1V10) have been made thicker because our threading pitch is larger than that of the Thor Labs parts
